# Welcome to my personal website https://tropicalt.ca.

## Terms of service
There's really nothing to it, I'm just building a personal website using OSS. You're free to take inspiration from the codebase, but I ask that you don't steal any of the content you find here. My articles, photos, videos, styling and all content present on the site are my own; and I'd appreciate you not reposting them (I guess that means my work is copywrite?)

## Privacy Policy
Theres a comment system built into the site that uses oauth for authentication and verification. In that way, I protect my site from anonymous posters and trolls, while being able to pull dynamic content into the site. I use your name, email and profile picture from your specific service (Facebook, Twitter, Google or Github) and store your name, email and a link to your profile picture (hosted on your service) in my BE. In the future I hope to open up a store that uses the same content and that allows you (the user) to purchase my photos off my website. If at any point you'd like me to delete your information from my DB, you're welcome to contact me at the email listed on my Github profile. I'll get back to you as soon as I can with a response along the lines of 'deleted' notifying you I've deleted the content from my BE.
